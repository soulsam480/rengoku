So I turned 25 this week. Well it's not an achievement but I'd say it's a checkpoint instead. Last 25 years have been good, privileged to say the least. Compared to the average person, I'd say I've been extremely lucky  and blessed at almost everything.



Initial years from what I can remember were typical school kid days. I had an academic target set by my parents that I was supposed to pursue. Think I did my best. Was not the best at it, but somehow managed to make it to high school.



High school was also not that difficult. Same plan, follow a set academic target, do your best. Well, I did make it out with good numbers and landed in senior secondary school.



When you're in your late teens, you go though love, affection and attraction for the first time. In rare cases it's genuine and may change your life for the better but for me it went the other way. I spent most of my senior secondary days chasing after someone who's never meant for me and did poorly with academics. Now that I think about it, I think it's fine. That taught me how not to be delusional ?



So here I was, going into engineering. As I said, I messed up my senior secondary school. I couldn't get into IIITs and NITs, but somehow I made it to a tire 3 government college. I was happy, tbh.



My time there was vibrant. Fate made sure I experience everything. From a noob startup founder to a hopeless romantic, I saw it all. I found genuine affection and love with her, but messed it all up again. It's alright, it's all in the past. Engineering ended well, academically ok.



So covid happend and I was at home. Unlike a traditional software job, I joined a company remotely. Learnt a ton.



So now here I am, drunk, somewhat at peace? Well peace is subjective but I think I've found my rhythm. I work at a startup now. Good poeple, good environment. I hope I'll somehow make it in life from this point. But there are some issues.



Looking back, I realized it's never been easy. It was not easy to study hard to top the exams, not easy to find a solution to some hard tech problem. Even though I've found my rhythm, sometimes by body gives up. It's difficult to walk longer distances now, climbing up a stair seems like a tough job. I often find myself confused, questioning my existence. It all happened so fast, am I ready to be an adult?



There are too many questions now. So turning an adult does suck. It does. 



That's it, it's kinda like a rant? I wanted to reflect upon the years I've lived but it ended like this. Maybe I'm truly an adult now. Thank you for reading and holding on. If you're someone close to me, please stay close.
