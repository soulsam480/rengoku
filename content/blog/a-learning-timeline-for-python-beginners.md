Python has been making headlines since it's advent. It's everywhere nowadays. The simplicity to write complex code and the parallel learning curve has made it the most sought after programming language. Its application can be extended to various domains such as Web development, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence and much more.

Python is extremely easy to learn and for people new to programming it's a piece of cake. The demand for good python programmers is getting skyrocketed. This is the high time to learn python and achieve expertise.

After mastering the basic concepts you can choose any of the domains of python programming which are Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science. These are the most popular domains but the application of python is extended to many fields.

I'm also a beginner of python. I have started learning python just a while ago. Javascript is my favorite language and I have been using it since the beginning. The simplicity and functionality of python forced me to try this out. Here is my timeline for getting started with programming in python. I will divide this into two categories of readers who are

* with a legit setup (Laptop etc.)
* Learning with Smartphones.

### **Guys with Smartphones (we are on the same boat ☺️☺️).**

Programming on a smartphone is troublesome but it's still intuitive. There are many android apps that offer very functional features to practice coding. If we can tailor a timeline for learning and practicing code on smartphones, the whole learning process will be a piece of cake. For every beginner the only factor which plays a big role is CONSISTENCY. If you are not consistent, you won't go anywhere with programming. There will be times when using a smartphone for coding will demotivate you but if you march on ahead with interest, you could gain a lot of knowledge.

#### **The Timeline**

* When we try to learn a new language, it's always better to learn the basics and practice thoroughly to get a good command over the basics. Basics will become the foundation for more complex and advanced programming in the future.
* Android users download **[Sololearn ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn).** Open the app and register using your email id. Move forward to the learn section and from programming languages select Python.
* I prefer sololearn for basics because it focuses on simplicity rather than complex teaching methods. After each lesson, there is a little assignment/question for quick practice for the lesson.
* After completing all the basic concepts from Sololearn, head over to **[Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org/)**  and start doing the beginner assignments. The platform also provides solutions for every assignment so it's easy to perform all the assignments.
* **How to practice:** Open Sololearn and move to the code section. Click on the plus icon and select python. For doing basic programming this is the best portable platform. After putting all of your code, hit run.
* Get over all the assignments and return back to sololearn. Then continue with the course. As you have a strong command on basics, moving will not be that much hard.
* After you pass through functions, try to build something using all the knowledge you have gathered so far. eg. a calculator, a guessing game, etc.
* Link to an awesome video on youtube by **freecodecamp** : **[Learn Python by Building Five Games - Full Course freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc)**. Here is a recommendation to some ideas to build something using the knowledge you have gained so far.
* Another video form **freecodecamp** on youtube : **[Learn python in 4hrs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw).**  for speed learners. Not exactly in 4hrs. but you can complete it in a week if you are determined.
* After completing all the basics and assignments you can move forward to focus on a specific domain on programming with python. You can take on machine learning, AI, Automation, Data Science, Deep Learning Algorithms and etc.
* Best of LUCK!!

### Guys with legit Setups (Fortunate folks!!)

having a laptop or any like device may speed up the process after you pass through the basics. During learning the basics, the experience with smartphones is the same as of setups. I have started programming from a smartphone. Having a setup can also boost the motivation needed to get going with the learning process. The mantra for success is the same as that of the smartphone users which is CONSISTENCY. So, gather up some confidence and let's start.

#### The Timeline

* As laptop/desktop users have the convenience of running their code in an IDE, it's better to know how to set up the environment for doing the same.
* Head over to [](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**[this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** and download python. If you are on windows download the windows release and for mac download the appropriate one.
* After the download is finished hit install. Once the installation gets completed go to python IDLE ( Integrated Development and Learning Environment). This is the place where we will be running our code.  
* For speed learning video lectures have always been the best option. As we are on the setup we can learn and run our code side by side. 
* The same video from Freecodecamp : **[Learn python in 4hrs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)** is amazing. The instructor has a very good way of teaching concepts. Download this video to your local machine and start.
* The instructor is using PyCharm as his IDE. He also has a guide for setting up the same environment as his in that video too. Follow that one if you want the same IDE as of him.
* During learning the concepts try manipulating the code on the video and experiment.  You have the setup and you gotta do it !!
* Also start doing assignments from **[Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org/)** and try to find more assignments on google after completing the basic ones. 
* Link to an awesome video on youtube by **freecodecamp** : **[Learn Python by Building Five Games - Full Course freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc)**. Here is a recommendation to some ideas to build something using the knowledge you have gained so far.
* After completing all the basics and assignments you can move forward to focus on a specific domain on programming with python. You can take on machine learning, AI, Automation, Data Science, Deep Learning Algorithms and etc.
* Best of LUCK !!

Always build something with the knowledge because as long as you will use it, it will only get polished more and more. Thanks for reading. Peace !! 🤘🤘
